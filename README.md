This is a simple program to serve as a tool to practice languages and improve your vocabulary, especially aimed for Spanish Speakers trying to learn a second language. 

There are 4 languages available so far: English, French, Italian and Portuguese.

All the Cards show the target word, the pronunciation (using text to speech), and the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) Transcription of the target word. 

After a few seconds, the card flips over to show the corresponsing translation.

Each language data file consists of the most common 1.000 words of that language.
